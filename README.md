### Motivation

When I develop application that have RecyclerView, I got problem happend from NestedScrollView and RecyclerView.

I deal with several list data and use NestedScrollView and some RecyclerViews. I dosen't work at some devices.  So I use RecyclerView viewType to create various view.

But when I deal with serveral list data on one RecyclerView Adapter, It's very hard to convert view position to list data index.

My coworker, ios develop introduce TableView to me. TableView control list and it is divided with section.

I thought "That good idea!" and made this library
